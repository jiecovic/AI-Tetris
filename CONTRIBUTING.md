## Code Style Conventions

### Rust Comment Style

- Prefer block-style comments for multi-line Rust comments:
  - doc comments: `/** ... */`
  - regular comments: `/* ... */`
- Avoid stacked `///` lines for longer multi-line comments unless rustdoc-specific formatting requires it.
- Keep comments focused on intent, constraints, and tradeoffs.
